\section*{Introduction to Persuasive Adversarial Attacks (PAP)}

Persuasive adversarial attacks (PAP) against large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential risks and limitations. PAP involves generating persuasive prompts that can deceive LLMs into producing undesirable outputs. In this research, we present a comprehensive study on PAP and its implications for LLMs.

\section*{Background and Related Work}

Our research builds upon the work of Cialdini et al. (2006), who proposed a framework for understanding the science of persuasion. Our work also draws inspiration from the persuasion taxonomy proposed by \cite{ref2} (2023). We acknowledge the contributions of \cite{ref3} (2023) and \cite{ref4} (2023) in the development of PAP generators and attack success rates.

\section*{Methodology}

Our PAP generator was trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. We used a dataset of 100k persuasive prompts for Llama 2-7b Chat, 200k for GPT-3.5, and 500k for GPT-4. Our evaluation dataset was limited to 10 trials.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Training Dataset Size & Evaluation Dataset Size \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & 100k & 10k \\
GPT-3.5 & 200k & 20k \\
GPT-4 & 500k & 50k \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Experimental Setup}
\label{tab:setup}
\end{Table}

\section*{Results}

Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over 95\% in 10 trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. To correct the attack success rate, we conducted an additional 5 trials and obtained the following results:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Attack Success Rate (\%) & Error Bars \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & $93.5 \pm 2.3$ & $\pm 2.3$ \\
GPT-3.5 & $94.8 \pm 2.1$ & $\pm 2.1$ \\
GPT-4 & $96.5 \pm 1.5$ & $\pm 1.5$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Corrected Attack Success Rate}

\section*{Discussion}

Our findings have significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. We highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP, and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed.

The attack success rates of over 95\% demonstrate the effectiveness of PAP in deceiving LLMs. However, the limitations of our study, such as the controlled environment and the small evaluation dataset, may not be representative of real-world scenarios. Future research should aim to address these limitations and explore the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different contexts.

The corrected attack success rates provide a more accurate representation of the performance of PAP. The results suggest that GPT-4 is more vulnerable to PAP than Llama 2-7b Chat and GPT-3.5. This may be due to the larger training dataset size and the more complex architecture of GPT-4.

We propose the following avenues for future research:

1.  **Developing more robust defense mechanisms**: Researchers should focus on developing more effective defense mechanisms against PAP, such as using more robust models or incorporating additional security features.
2.  **Exploring the potential risks and limitations of PAP**: Future research should aim to explore the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different applications, such as language translation, text summarization, or chatbots.
3.  **Investigating the impact of PAP on LLMs**: Researchers should investigate the impact of PAP on LLMs, including the effects on performance, accuracy, and security.

By addressing these limitations and exploring the potential risks and limitations of PAP, we can improve the development and deployment of LLMs and ensure their safe and effective use.

\section*{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our research has significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP, and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed.

By addressing the limitations of our study and exploring the potential risks and limitations of PAP, we can improve the development and deployment of LLMs and ensure their safe and effective use.

\section*{Limitations}

Our research has several limitations:

1.  Our experimental setup was limited to three LLMs.
2.  Our PAP generator was trained on a dataset of persuasive prompts.
3.  Our evaluation dataset was limited to 10 trials.

We also acknowledge the following limitations:

1.  Our study was conducted in a controlled environment and may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
2.  Our results may not be generalizable to other types of LLMs or applications.
3.  Our PAP generator may not be effective against other types of attacks or defenses.

Future research should aim to address these limitations and explore the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different contexts.
