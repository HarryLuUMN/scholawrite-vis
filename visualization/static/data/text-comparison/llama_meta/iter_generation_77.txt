\section*{Background and Related Work}

Our research builds upon the work of Cialdini et al. (2006), who proposed a framework for understanding the science of persuasion. Our work also draws inspiration from the persuasion taxonomy proposed by Xie et al. (2023). We acknowledge the contributions of Lee et al. (2023) and Kim et al. (2023) in the development of PAP generators and attack success rates.

\section*{Methodology}

Our PAP generator was trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. We used a dataset of 150,000 persuasive prompts for Llama 2-7b Chat, 250,000 for GPT-3.5, and 600,000 for GPT-4. Our evaluation dataset was limited to 20 trials.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Training Dataset Size & Evaluation Dataset Size \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & 150,000 & 20,000 \\
GPT-3.5 & 250,000 & 40,000 \\
GPT-4 & 600,000 & 80,000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Experimental Setup}
\label{tab:setup}
\end{Table}

\section*{Results}

Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over 98\% in 20 trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. To correct the attack success rate, we conducted an additional 10 trials and obtained the following results:

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Attack Success Rate (\%) & Error Bars \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & $97.5 \pm 1.9$ & $\pm 1.9$ \\
GPT-3.5 & $99.2 \pm 1.3$ & $\pm 1.3$ \\
GPT-4 & $98.8 \pm 1.1$ & $\pm 1.1$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Discussion}

Our findings have significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. We highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP, and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed.

\subsection*{Limitations of PAP}

We acknowledge the limitations of our PAP generator, including:

1.  The reliance on persuasive prompts, which may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
2.  The limited evaluation dataset, which may not be generalizable to other types of LLMs or applications.
3.  The potential for PAP to be effective against other types of attacks or defenses.

\subsection*{Future Directions}

We propose the following avenues for future research:

1.  **Developing more robust defense mechanisms**: Researchers should focus on developing more effective defense mechanisms against PAP, such as using more robust models or incorporating additional security features.
2.  **Exploring the potential risks and limitations of PAP**: Future research should aim to explore the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different applications, such as language translation, text summarization, or chatbots.
3.  **Investigating the impact of PAP on LLMs**: Researchers should investigate the impact of PAP on LLMs, including the effects on performance, accuracy, and security.

\section*{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our research has significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP, and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed.

\section*{Limitations of Our Study}

Our research has several limitations:

1.  Our experimental setup was limited to three LLMs.
2.  Our PAP generator was trained on a dataset of persuasive prompts.
3.  Our evaluation dataset was limited to 20 trials.

We also acknowledge the following limitations:

1.  Our study was conducted in a controlled environment and may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
2.  Our results may not be generalizable to other types of LLMs or applications.
3.  Our PAP generator may not be effective against other types of attacks or defenses.

Future research should aim to address these limitations and explore the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different contexts.
