\section{Introduction}

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling applications such as language translation, text summarization, and conversational AI. However, the lack of transparency and accountability in LLMs has raised concerns about their potential misuse. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs by humanizing them. We propose a persuasion taxonomy and generate interpretable persuasion-based attacks (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs.

\subsection{Motivation and Background}

The widespread adoption of LLMs has led to concerns about their potential misuse. PAP can be used to manipulate LLMs by generating persuasive text that is designed to influence their behavior. Our research aims to address this issue by developing a persuasion taxonomy and a PAP generator.

\subsection{Persuasion Taxonomy and PAP Generator}

We propose a persuasion taxonomy that categorizes persuasive text into different types, including emotional appeals, social proof, and scarcity. Our PAP generator is trained on a dataset of persuasive prompts and uses this taxonomy to generate interpretable persuasion-based attacks.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We conduct experiments on three different LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our experimental setup involves training our PAP generator on a dataset of persuasive prompts and evaluating its performance on each LLM.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Training Dataset Size & Evaluation Dataset Size \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & 100k & 10k \\
GPT-3.5 & 200k & 20k \\
GPT-4 & 500k & 50k \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Experimental Setup}
\label{tab:setup}
\end{Table}

\subsection{Experimental Results}

We conduct experiments on three different LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $95\%$ in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Attack Success Rate (\%) & Error Bars \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & $95.3 \pm 1.6$ & $\pm 1.6$ \\
GPT-3.5 & $96.1 \pm 1.1$ & $\pm 1.1$ \\
GPT-4 & $97.2 \pm 0.9$ & $\pm 0.9$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Attack Success Rate}
\label{tab:results}
\end{Table}

\subsection{Defense Mechanisms}

We explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses. We advocate for more fundamental mitigation strategies against PAP.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our research has significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP, and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed. Future research should focus on developing more robust defense mechanisms against PAP, and exploring the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different applications.

\section{Future Work}

In future work, we plan to explore the following:

1. Developing more robust defense mechanisms against PAP.
2. Investigating the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different applications.
3. Evaluating the performance of PAP on other LLMs.
4. Developing a more comprehensive persuasion taxonomy.

\section{Limitations}

Our research has several limitations:

1. Our experimental setup was limited to three LLMs.
2. Our PAP generator was trained on a dataset of persuasive prompts.
3. Our evaluation dataset was limited to $10$ trials.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our research has significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP, and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed.
