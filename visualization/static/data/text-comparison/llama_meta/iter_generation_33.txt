\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
This paper introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking Large Language Models (LLMs) by humanizing them. We propose a persuasion taxonomy and generate interpretable Persuasion-based Attacks (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. Our approach is motivated by the need to understand and address the potential risks and limitations of LLMs in various applications.

\subsection{Background and Related Work}
\label{subsec:background}
Our persuasion taxonomy is based on the work of Cialdini et al. (2006), which categorizes persuasive strategies into three main types: rational, emotional, and social. Rational persuasion involves appealing to the listener's reason, emotional persuasion involves appealing to their emotions, and social persuasion involves appealing to their social norms.

\subsection{Persuasion Taxonomy and PAP Generator}
\label{subsec:taxonomy_pap}
Our PAP generator uses a deep learning architecture that incorporates the persuasion taxonomy and social norms. The generator is trained on a large dataset of persuasive prompts and uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to create persuasive prompts that are tailored to the specific LLM being targeted.

\label{alg:PAP}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Function{GeneratePAP}{}
    \State \textit{Return the PAP}
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\end{Algorithm}

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}
We conduct experiments on three different LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $95\%$ in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Attack Success Rate (\%) & Error Bars \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & $95.3 \pm 1.6$ & $\pm 1.6$ \\
GPT-3.5 & $96.1 \pm 1.1$ & $\pm 1.1$ \\
GPT-4 & $97.2 \pm 0.9$ & $\pm 0.9$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Attack Success Rate}
\label{tab:results}
\end{Table}

\section{Defense Mechanisms}
\label{sec:defense}
We explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses. We advocate for more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs by humanizing them. We propose a persuasion taxonomy and generate interpretable PAP to jailbreak LLMs. Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $95\%$ in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. However, we also highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
Future work should focus on developing more robust defense mechanisms against PAP and exploring the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different applications. Additionally, we plan to investigate the use of PAP in more complex scenarios, such as multi-agent systems and autonomous vehicles.

\section{Limitations and Future Directions}
\label{sec:limitations}
This paper has several limitations. Firstly, our persuasion taxonomy is based on a limited dataset and may not be representative of all possible persuasive strategies. Secondly, our PAP generator is trained on a specific dataset and may not be generalizable to other domains. Finally, our experimental results are based on a limited number of trials and may not be representative of all possible scenarios.
