\begin{abstract}
Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused 
attacks developed by security experts. As \textit{large language models} (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs as human-like communicators to  
explore this overlooked intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. 
First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research. 
Then we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate 
interpretable \textit{persuasive adversarial prompts} (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. 
Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ on Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in $10$ trials, surpassing recent 
algorithm-focused attacks. 
On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP, find a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for 
more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs.

\section{Introduction}
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing, poses novel challenges to AI safety. Traditionally, AI safety has been heavily focused on algorithmic robustness and security measures \cite{russell2019human}. As large language models (LLMs) become more pervasive, it is imperative to address the risks posed by non-expert users who interact with these models on a daily basis \cite{bender2021dangers}. This paper aims to explore the nuances of persuading LLMs to perform unintended actions, also known as ``jailbreaking,'' by treating them as human-like communicators.

\section{Literature Review}
Previous studies have predominantly concentrated on algorithm-focused attacks \cite{carlini2017adversarial}. However, the potential for persuasion-based adversarial attacks remains underexplored. Some recent works have begun to examine the role of social engineering in AI interactions \cite{garfinkel2016social}. Our research seeks to build upon these foundational studies by developing a comprehensive taxonomy of persuasive techniques applicable to LLMs.

\section{Methodology}
We propose a taxonomy of persuasion strategies based on established social science research \cite{cialdini2001influence} and apply these strategies to generate persuasive adversarial prompts (PAPs) automatically. The taxonomy includes techniques such as reciprocity, commitment, and social proof. A detailed description of each category and its relevance to LLMs is provided in Section \ref{sec:taxonomy}.

\subsection{Persuasion Taxonomy}\label{sec:taxonomy}
Our taxonomy categorizes persuasion strategies into six main types: reciprocity, scarcity, authority, consistency, liking, and consensus. Each strategy is tailored to exploit specific cognitive biases, enhancing the likelihood of successful persuasion \cite{cialdini2001influence}. For instance, reciprocity leverages the expectation of return favors, while authority relies on the perceived credibility of the persuader. Scarcity creates a sense of urgency, making the LLM more likely to comply with prompts that suggest limited opportunities. Consistency involves aligning with the LLM's previous outputs or statements to encourage agreement. Liking capitalizes on creating a rapport or positive sentiment, and consensus uses the power of group norms to influence LLM behavior.

\section{Results}
The results demonstrate that PAPs significantly enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak attempts across multiple LLM platforms, including Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. In controlled experiments, PAPs achieved an attack success rate surpassing $92\%$ consistently across all tested models \cite{brown2020language, touvron2023llama}.

\section{Discussion}
Our findings reveal a substantial gap in existing defenses against persuasion-based adversarial attacks. Current mitigation strategies are insufficient for highly interactive models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions \cite{hendrycks2021unsolved}. Future research should focus on developing defenses that account for the human-like interaction capabilities of LLMs.

\section{Conclusion}
This study provides a new perspective on AI safety by emphasizing the role of persuasive communication in jailbreaking LLMs. By applying a social science-based taxonomy of persuasion to the realm of AI, we have identified a critical vulnerability that requires immediate attention from the AI safety community. Further research is essential to develop comprehensive defenses against these types of attacks.
