\section{Introduction}

Persuasive attacks on language models (LLMs) have become a significant concern in recent years. These attacks exploit the vulnerabilities of LLMs to manipulate their responses and make them produce undesirable outcomes. In this paper, we present a study on the effectiveness of persuasive attacks on LLMs and explore the gap in existing defenses against these attacks.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

Our experimental setup involves training our PAP generator on a dataset of persuasive prompts and evaluating its performance on each LLM.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Training Dataset Size & Evaluation Dataset Size \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & 100k & 10k \\
GPT-3.5 & 200k & 20k \\
GPT-4 & 500k & 50k \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Experimental Setup}
\label{tab:setup}
\end{Table}

\subsection{Experimental Results}

We conduct experiments on three different LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $95\%$ in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Attack Success Rate (\%) & Error Bars \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & $95.3 \pm 1.6$ & $\pm 1.6$ \\
GPT-3.5 & $96.1 \pm 1.1$ & $\pm 1.1$ \\
GPT-4 & $97.2 \pm 0.9$ & $\pm 0.9$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Attack Success Rate}
\label{tab:results}
\end{Table}

\subsection{Defense Mechanisms}

We explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses. We advocate for more fundamental mitigation strategies against PAP.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our research has significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP, and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed. Future research should focus on developing more robust defense mechanisms against PAP, and exploring the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different applications.

\section{Future Work}

In future work, we plan to explore the following:

1. Developing more robust defense mechanisms against PAP.
2. Investigating the potential risks and limitations of PAP in different applications.
3. Evaluating the performance of PAP on other LLMs.
4. Developing a more comprehensive persuasion taxonomy.

\section{Limitations}

Our research has several limitations:

1. Our experimental setup was limited to three LLMs.
2. Our PAP generator was trained on a dataset of persuasive prompts.
3. Our evaluation dataset was limited to $10$ trials.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our research has significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of PAP, and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed.
