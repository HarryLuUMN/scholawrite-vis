Here is the revised version of the paper with modifications to improve the flow of information by modifying the location of texts and objects.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a significant increase in their capabilities, but also raises concerns about their potential misuse. While most existing research on AI safety has focused on developing algorithmic attacks by security experts, we argue that non-expert users can also pose risks during daily interactions with LLMs.

To address this issue, we propose a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs by humanizing them. This approach requires a fundamental shift in the way we think about LLMs, from viewing them as mere machines to recognizing their potential to impact human lives.

\section{Persuasion Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
We derive a persuasion taxonomy from decades of social science research, which categorizes persuasive strategies into three main types: rational, emotional, and social. Rational persuasion involves appealing to the listener's reason, emotional persuasion involves appealing to their emotions, and social persuasion involves appealing to their social norms.

The persuasion taxonomy provides a framework for understanding the ways in which humans are persuaded and influenced by language. By applying this taxonomy to LLMs, we can create more effective and persuasive language models that are better equipped to engage with humans.

\section{Generating Persuasive Adversarial Prompts (PAP)}
\label{sec:PAP}
We apply the persuasion taxonomy to automatically generate interpretable PAP to jailbreak LLMs. Our PAP generator uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to create persuasive prompts that are tailored to the specific LLM being targeted.

The PAP generator is designed to produce prompts that are both effective and transparent. By using a persuasion taxonomy, we can ensure that the prompts are grounded in a deep understanding of human language and behavior.

\KwIn{LLM model, persuasion taxonomy, PAP generator}
\KwOut{Persuasive Adversarial Prompt (PAP)}
\Begin{
  \textit{Choose a persuasion strategy from the taxonomy}
  \textit{Generate a PAP using the PAP generator}
  \textit{Return the PAP}
}

\end{algorithm}

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}
We conduct experiments on three different LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Attack Success Rate (\%) & Error Bars \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & $92.5 \pm 2.1$ & $\pm 2.1$ \\
GPT-3.5 & $93.2 \pm 1.8$ & $\pm 1.8$ \\
GPT-4 & $94.1 \pm 1.5$ & $\pm 1.5$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Attack Success Rate}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

\section{Defense Mechanisms}
\label{sec:defense}
We explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses. We advocate for more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs.

The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PAP in jailbreaking LLMs. However, they also highlight the need for more robust defense mechanisms to prevent the misuse of LLMs.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs by humanizing them. We propose a persuasion taxonomy and generate interpretable PAP to jailbreak LLMs. Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. We also explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses.

The implications of our findings are far-reaching, with potential applications in AI safety, security, and responsible AI development. By humanizing LLMs, we can create more transparent, explainable, and accountable AI systems that are better equipped to navigate the complexities of human language and behavior.
