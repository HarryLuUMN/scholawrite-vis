\begin{abstract}
Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused 
attacks developed by security experts. As \textit{large language models} (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs as human-like communicators to  
explore this overlooked intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. 
First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research.
Then we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate 
interpretable \textit{persuasive adversarial prompts} (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. 
Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ on Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in $10$ trials, surpassing recent 
algorithm-focused attacks. 
On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP, find a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for 
more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The increasing sophistication of large language models (LLMs) has led to a growing concern about their safety and security. Most existing research on AI safety has focused on developing algorithmic attacks by security experts. However, this paper argues that non-expert users can also pose risks during daily interactions with LLMs. We propose a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs by humanizing them, which involves exploring the intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety.

\section{Persuasion Taxonomy}
\label{sec:taxonomy}
We derive a persuasion taxonomy from decades of social science research, which categorizes persuasive strategies into three main types: \textit{rational}, \textit{emotional}, and \textit{social}. Rational persuasion involves appealing to the listener's reason, emotional persuasion involves appealing to their emotions, and social persuasion involves appealing to their social norms.

\section{Generating Persuasive Adversarial Prompts (PAP)}
\label{sec:PAP}
We apply the persuasion taxonomy to automatically generate interpretable PAP to jailbreak LLMs. Our PAP generator uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to create persuasive prompts that are tailored to the specific LLM being targeted.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoNoLine
\KwIn{LLM model, persuasion taxonomy, PAP generator}
\KwOut{Persuasive Adversarial Prompt (PAP)}
\Begin{
  \textit{Choose a persuasion strategy from the taxonomy}
  \textit{Generate a PAP using the PAP generator}
  \textit{Return the PAP}
}

\end{algorithm}

\section{Experimental Results}
\label{sec:results}
We conduct experiments on three different LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks.

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Attack Success Rate (\%) \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & 92.5 \\
GPT-3.5 & 93.2 \\
GPT-4 & 94.1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Attack Success Rate}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

\section{Defense Mechanisms}
\label{sec:defense}
We explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses. We advocate for more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs by humanizing them. We propose a persuasion taxonomy and generate interpretable PAP to jailbreak LLMs. Our results show that PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. We also explore various mechanisms against PAP and find a significant gap in existing defenses.
