\section*{Introduction}

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by enabling computers to understand and generate human-like language. However, concerns about their potential risks and limitations, including persuasion attacks, have arisen. In this study, we investigate the risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs.

\textit{Persuasion attacks} are a type of attack that manipulates the output of an LLM by providing carefully crafted input. These attacks exploit the strengths of LLMs, such as their ability to generate human-like language.

\section*{Experimental Setup}

Our experimental setup involves training a persuasion attack generator (PAP generator) on a dataset of persuasive prompts and evaluating its performance on various tasks, including language translation, text summarization, and question answering. We use three LLMs, namely Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, and train the PAP generator on a dataset of 150,000 persuasive prompts for each LLM.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Training Dataset Size & Evaluation Dataset Size \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & 150,000 & 20,000 \\
GPT-3.5 & 250,000 & 40,000 \\
GPT-4 & 600,000 & 80,000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{Table}

\section*{Results}

Our results show that the attack success rate of our PAP generator is consistently high across all three LLMs, with GPT-3.5 achieving the highest attack success rate of 99.2\% $\pm$ 1.3\%. We also observe that the performance of each LLM on different tasks was affected by the persuasion attack.

\section*{Discussion}

Our findings have significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. We highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed. We recommend that LLM developers incorporate robustness testing and adversarial training into their development pipelines.

Moreover, our research suggests that the development of LLMs should be accompanied by a careful consideration of the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks. This includes the development of robustness testing and adversarial training methods, as well as the incorporation of these methods into the development pipelines of LLMs.

\section*{Limitations of Our Study}

Our research has several limitations:

1.  Our experimental setup was limited to three LLMs.
2.  Our PAP generator was trained on a dataset of persuasive prompts.
3.  Our evaluation dataset was limited to 20 trials.

We also acknowledge the following limitations:

1.  Our study was conducted in a controlled environment and may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
2.  Our results may not be generalizable to other types of LLMs or applications.
3.  Our PAP generator may not be effective against other types of attacks or defenses.

Future research should aim to address these limitations and explore the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs in different contexts.

\section*{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our research highlights the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs. We suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed to prevent these attacks and ensure the security and performance of LLMs.

\section*{Recommendations}

Based on our findings, we recommend the following:

1.  LLM developers should incorporate robustness testing and adversarial training into their development pipelines.
2.  Researchers should explore the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs in different contexts.
3.  Developers should consider the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks when designing and deploying LLMs.

\section*{Future Research Directions}

Our research highlights several potential research directions:

1.  Investigating the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies, such as robustness testing and adversarial training.
2.  Exploring the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks in different contexts, including real-world scenarios.
3.  Developing more sophisticated PAP generators that can adapt to different LLMs and tasks.

By addressing these limitations and exploring the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs, we can develop more effective mitigation strategies and ensure the security and performance of LLMs.
