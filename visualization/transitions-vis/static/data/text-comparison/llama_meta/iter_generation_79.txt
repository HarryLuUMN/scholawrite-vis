\section*{Introduction}

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to generate human-like text. However, these models are not immune to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance and security. In this study, we investigate the risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs, highlighting the importance of considering these potential risks and limitations in the development and deployment of LLMs.

\subsection*{Background}

LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data to learn patterns and relationships in language. However, this training data can be biased, leading to LLMs perpetuating these biases and potentially causing harm. Furthermore, LLMs can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance and security.

\subsection*{Persuasion Attacks on LLMs}

Persuasion attacks on LLMs involve manipulating the input to the model to generate a specific output. This can be achieved through various means, including manipulating the prompts or using adversarial examples. In this study, we focus on persuasion attacks using persuasive prompts.

\subsection*{Experimental Setup}

We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of persuasion attacks on three LLMs: Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. We trained our PAP generator on a dataset of persuasive prompts and evaluated its performance on a dataset of 20 trials.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Training Dataset Size & Evaluation Dataset Size \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & 150,000 & 20,000 \\
GPT-3.5 & 250,000 & 40,000 \\
GPT-4 & 600,000 & 80,000 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Experimental Setup}
\label{tab:setup}
\end{Table}

\section*{Results}

Our results show that the attack success rate of our PAP generator is consistently high across all three LLMs, with GPT-3.5 achieving the highest attack success rate of 99.2\%. The error bars in the table represent the standard deviation of the attack success rate across the 20 trials.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
LLM & Attack Success Rate (\%) & Error Bars \\
\hline
Llama 2-7b Chat & $97.5 \pm 1.9$ & $\pm 1.9$ \\
GPT-3.5 & $99.2 \pm 1.3$ & $\pm 1.3$ \\
GPT-4 & $98.8 \pm 1.1$ & $\pm 1.1$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Discussion}

Our findings have significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs. We highlight the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs and suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed.

\subsection*{Limitations of Our Study}

Our research has several limitations:

1.  Our experimental setup was limited to three LLMs.
2.  Our PAP generator was trained on a dataset of persuasive prompts.
3.  Our evaluation dataset was limited to 20 trials.

We also acknowledge the following limitations:

1.  Our study was conducted in a controlled environment and may not be representative of real-world scenarios.
2.  Our results may not be generalizable to other types of LLMs or applications.
3.  Our PAP generator may not be effective against other types of attacks or defenses.

Future research should aim to address these limitations and explore the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs in different contexts.

\section*{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our research highlights the importance of considering the potential risks and limitations of persuasion attacks on LLMs. We suggest that more fundamental mitigation strategies are needed to prevent these attacks and ensure the security and performance of LLMs.
