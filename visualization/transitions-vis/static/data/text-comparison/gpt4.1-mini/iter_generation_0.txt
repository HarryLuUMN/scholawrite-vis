\begin{abstract}
Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused 
attacks developed by security experts. As \textit{large language models} (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective on jailbreaking LLMs as human-like communicators to  
explore this overlooked intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. 
First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research \cite{Cialdini2001,Perloff2010}.
Then we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate 
interpretable \textit{persuasive adversarial prompts} (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. 
Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ on Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in $10$ trials, surpassing recent 
algorithm-focused attacks \cite{Brown2020Language,Bommasani2021Opportunities}. 
On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP, find a significant gap in existing defenses \cite{Xu2021BotAdversarial}, and advocate for 
more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs \cite{Zhou2023InteractiveDefense}.
